Except this for any multi directional contact 's designer it is possible that can control the headers of HTTP of the sending by the server according to its desire and like this when inter is not needed -LRB- for example news and business rise and fall pages -RRB- then the collection of data can be saved so that every time coming on the page , the latest data collection will be displayed on serial order .
other than this if more connected like designer will also possible which was send by Mayel send HTTP can convert in to it 's own language according to it 's will like this different media which can safe Mawad from destruction to that when it can to paper it will show new contents every time

Normally , a simple mathematical procedure could be easily solved with the help of a calculator , but if the mathematical procedure involves large number of digits , then it requires a lot of time in order to solved by the calculator . For example , if a problem involves the addition of all the digits between 1 and 1000 , then the calculator 's buttons would have to be pressed more than 1000 times and more time would be required . But if a computer is provided with instructions to analyze this procedure only once , then it will store them inside itself and would be able to execute this mathematical procedure by utilizing these instructions the next time around , which would only take a few moments .
In General to make easy the calculation we use the calculator like wise to make easy the documentation sending the messages , saving the orders etc , can be done in computer .
Generally , if any simple calculation is needed , it can be easily done by the calculator , but if the calculation is related to long figures then if it is done by conventional method or by arithmetic then much more extra time is required , for example if summation of all the numbers between 1 and 1000 is needed then nearly one thousand times the button of addition is to be pressed , and time needed to do this will also be more but if the computer is instructed to do the task then it will store it inside its memory and for next time it will use it and can perform the arithmetic operation in few seconds only .
normally if there is some simple problem it can be done by calculator but if it is mathematical problem the it has to be done in some particular way so that requires more time , for example you have to add from 1 to 1000 then you have to press all buttons and more time is require but if you give all these instruction to the shumarinda one time so from next time it will do it self automatically which requires only seconds

Hitlers popularity was due to the agenda of his party and in the future only due to that agenda not only Germany broken into two parts and also Hitler is considered to be one of the worst personalities of the history . Today in Europe name of Hitler is considered as a curse like the name of yazid is in Muslims . After the death of Hitler in 1945 , none of the mother would have named her son Hitler .
The basis of Hitler 's popularity was his party 's ideology . Later on , due to this very ideology , not only Germany was split into two but Hitler was also ranked among the worst personalities of human history . Even today , Hitler 's name is considered as much of a curse among the western nations as the name of Yazid is among the Muslims . After Hitler 's death in 1945 , perhaps no mother ever named her child as such .
Hitler popularity was because of the theory of there party and with this Germany divided into two parts and also in history hitler become a most disgrace person , as in Muslim yazid word is like a shit in western nation hitler is considered as a shit , after the end of hitler in 1945 in think no mother has become a name as Hitler
On the being the imported personality party was giving him a special category and this resulted to divide the Germany in 2 parts .

The both sir seyyad ahamad khan and Galib could make a proper friendship but they were living the same part of Delhi .
due to a big age difference about 20 years , a mutual friendship could not be created between Mirza Ghalib and Syed Ahmed Khan however the yearly settlement of both contemporaneous in Delhi Durbar is the main reason of their Acquaintance and Vicinity .
Because of this age difference of about 20 years between Mirza Ghalib and Syed Ahmed Khan , they were not able to maintain good friendship but the long co-existence of both of them in the same place , Delhi had definitely brought them together to a very close acquaintance .
Ghalib 's this letter and its reference to Syed Ahmed Khan reveals the their correspondence . It also comes to fore that along with this letter Ghalib sent a copy of one of his Naat -LRB- a poem in praise of the prophet -RRB- to Syed Ahmed Khan
Ghalib this letter and the reference to this books and it also shows the relation between books with this letter it also shows that ghalib sent his natai masnoi with this letter to saeed ahmed khan
this letter of galib and in this the reference of syed ahmed khans book proves the written relation also between them and it is known with this letter that he sent his poetry also to syed ahmed khan

While all these organs of the state are creatures created and bound by law ,
according to Aina e Akbari the opposing of Ghalib iswas right according to this Ghalib before this incident have alredy written the book on the government of Mughals
This was the reason too that before the aain akbary 's unacceptably Galib has written the content of mohaliya kingdom .
In our view Ghalib 's unpleasant comments on Aain e Akbari can be proved unjust by the fact that Ghalib himself has written a topic on Mughal kingdom some years before this unpleasant happening .
according to aaine akberi the against of galib is some thing clear near to us that before this incident galib wrote the history of mogul titled mahar neem roz
Islamic genealogies correctly state that Nimrod was the son of Cush , but incorrectly state that he lived
We 'll suffice with a brief mention of a few people in the combined circle of influence of Ghalib & Syed Ahmad Khan , whose reference has passed our eyes while analyzing the biographies or literary influences of these intellectuals .

we will say about only those who comes in the circle of galib and syed ahmad khan whose reference is passed from our eyes according to them

Laurence roberts has given the responsibility of networking Paul Baran are also used for these efforts who help to maximize networking system introduction
Likckider handed over the responsibilities to invent the network to the Laurence Roberts .
Licklider handed over the responsibility of realizing the network to Laurence Roberts . Roberts benefited from the work of Paul Baran , who had preferred ' packet switching ' over ' circuit switching ' for a rapid increase in the development and chances of networking system .

means actually , internet is depend on international co-ordination and exchanging the plots
it means the inter net was depand on the banul robat on it trans faration .
means now the base of internet is totally depend on international users
